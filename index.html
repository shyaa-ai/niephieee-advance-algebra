    <p>
      Strong problem-solving abilities are developed through the straightforward and interesting introduction to fundamental mathematical ideas that the algebra course offers. Students study subjects like variables, equations, functions, polynomials, and practical uses of algebraic reasoning throughout the sessions.
      The course's main objectives are to comprehend patterns, analyze relationships, and develop rational and self-assured problem-solving techniques. The course helps students build a strong foundation that they can use to higher-level mathematics and daily decision-making by teaching algebra in a realistic and approachable manner.

    <h2>My Learnings</h2>
    <p>
      I learned how to understand and work with the fundamental ideas that make up more advanced math. I became familiar with variables, expressions, simple equations, and how to combine like terms correctly. 
      I also learned the importance of following steps carefully, especially when solving equations or simplifying expressions. These lessons helped me build confidence because they showed me that even complex problems can be solved when I understand the basics.
      Overall, the basic lessons gave me a strong foundation and made Algebra feel more manageable and less intimidating.

        <h2>Reflection</h2>
    <p>
    I realize it’s not just about numbers but about thinking logically and solving problems. Our instructor made learning easier and more engaging by explaining concepts clearly and connecting them to real-life examples. 
      His patience and encouragement made it comfortable to ask questions and explore solutions. 
      Because of his teaching, I’ve not only improved in Algebra but also developed better problem-solving skills that I can use beyond class.
